# fruta-ios-native-app-test-automation

I created this project to demonstrate working knowledge of multiple tools:
1. WebDriverIO
2. Appium
3. JavaScript/TypeScript
4. Mocha test framework
5. Page/Screen Object Model

It tests an Apple-developed iOS sample app, [Fruta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui), which I opened in XCode, built, and have included in the [*apps*](https://github.com/cafshari/fruta-ios-native-app-test-automation/tree/85028236e20f32b9b6d0e80f44e01f1aae0abb97/apps/Fruta_iOS.app) folder of this repository as an .app file. The tests currently are configured to run locally on an iOS simulator.
